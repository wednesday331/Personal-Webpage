# Project 0: Very Basic HTML Page
For this project, I have four sections explaining a little bit about who I am, what I like, where I have been and what's on my mind at the moment. These sections showcase the very basic HTML, CSS, and SCSS skills that I have learned when I started out coding.

## Homepage:
For the homepage, we have three main components, which is the navigation panel, a description and a picture. The Navigation panel was created using an unordered list and when you hover over it, the background color and the font color changes. An Scss file was used to create the navigation panel because of the many variables involved. The picture in this page was sized to 50% of the screen width so when the screen shrinks, the picture adjusts accordingly.

## What I Like Page:
When we click on the "What I like tab" in the navigation bar, we are redirected to this webpage. Everything is center aligned, and the key features that show my basic html skills involve the table and the use of media query. As it says on the page, if we adjust the screen, you would be able to see some of my favorite colors, which are green and blue, showing the use of media query. As the width of the screen is adjusted, you can also see that the table remains at the center of the page. This was done by setting both margin-left and margin-right to auto. In all of the pages that are not the homepage, I have included a button that says "Back to the Homepage!". So, when we click on this, we are directed back to the homepage.

## Where I have Been Page:
For the "Where I have been page", the places I have lived in are displayed in different colors. The reason for this is to demonstrate my ability to use simple nesting in CSS. Using an unordered list, the three sentences were created and then a combination of id and class features were used to display the countries in bold while having different colors.

## What's on My Mind Page:
Finally, for the "What's on My Mind" page, this is a page intending to demonstrate Bootstrap's grid model. The light blue grid spaces are evenly spaced out and as the window width is changed, the individual sections are readjusted as well to look better. Eventually when the width is small enough, it forms a column because it is displayed as a flexbox.

*Hope you enjoy the page!*
